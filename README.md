# NYC-Citi-Bike-Analysis Project
 

## Project Overview

The Citi Bike Analysis Project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project that examines the Citi Bike trip data in New York City. The primary goal of this project was to explore patterns and trends in bike usage, identify key factors influencing ridership, and present insights through interactive visualizations created using Tableau.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze the Citi Bike trip data to identify trends in bike usage.
- Explore factors affecting trip duration and popularity, such as time of day, day of the week, and user demographics.
- Visualize the data using Tableau to provide interactive and insightful dashboards.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the publicly available Citi Bike trip data for New York City. The data includes trip start and end times, trip duration, start and end stations, bike ID, user type (subscriber or customer), gender, and birth year.

## Key Steps and Process

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Data Import:** Imported the raw Citi Bike data into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, converted data types, and filtered the data to include only relevant records.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features such as trip duration in minutes, day of the week, and hour of the day.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated key statistics to understand the distribution of trip durations, age groups, and gender distribution.
- **Visualization:** Used matplotlib and seaborn to create initial visualizations that helped identify patterns and outliers.

### 3. Data Visualization in Tableau
- **Trip Duration Analysis:** Created histograms and box plots to analyze the distribution of trip durations.
- **Hourly and Weekly Trends:** Visualized trip counts across different hours of the day and days of the week to understand peak usage times.
- **Demographic Analysis:** Analyzed the distribution of trips by user type, gender, and age groups.

### 4. Key Insights
- **Peak Hours:** The majority of trips occur during morning and evening rush hours, indicating heavy usage by commuters.
- **User Type:** Subscribers (annual members) account for a larger proportion of trips compared to casual customers.
- **Demographic Trends:** The majority of users are male, and a significant number of trips are made by individuals in their 20s and 30s.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Volume:** Managing the large dataset required efficient data handling techniques, including filtering and aggregation.
- **Missing Data:** Some records had missing or incorrect values, which were handled through data cleaning and imputation.
- **Visualization:** Creating effective visualizations that conveyed meaningful insights required iterative experimentation with different chart types.

## Project Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The notebooks used for data cleaning, exploration, and initial analysis.
- **Tableau Dashboards:** Interactive dashboards showcasing key insights from the analysis.
- **Presentation:** A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project, process, and findings.

## How to View the Project
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** You can view and run the notebooks in your local environment.
- **Tableau Dashboards:** The interactive Tableau dashboards can be accessed [here](#). (Replace `#` with the actual link to your Tableau Public dashboard).
- **GitHub Repository:** The entire project, including the notebooks, data, and presentation, is available on this GitHub repository.

## Next Steps
- Further analysis could be done to predict future bike usage patterns using machine learning models.
- Additional data sources, such as weather data, could be integrated to analyze the impact of weather on bike usage.
